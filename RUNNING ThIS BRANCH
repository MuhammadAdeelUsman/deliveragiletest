--previous branch success ...make sure this works here first--
make sure db exists ...can be done by running docker-compose.yml (api version)
Run Tests from code lens
Connection string comes from appsettings.development.json file in API
and that points to localhost,1620


-------------------------below is really for next branch------
ensure that when running compose up from docker test that the dbconnection server is db, not localhost
Mistakes:
  I didn't include the 
  environment:
      - ConnectionStrings:DB_Conn

  setting in the docker-compose-test.yml for the test service 
  so it was using the conneciton string from appsettings.development.json which was localhost

I keep having to remove target from flyway service in compose
other mistakes: depends on missing on unittest service
