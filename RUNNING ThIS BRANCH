--previous branch success ...make sure this works here first--
make sure db exists ...can be done by running docker-compose.yml (api version)
Run Tests from code lens
Connection string comes from appsettings.development.json file in API
and that points to localhost,1620
----------
make sure regular docker compose runs correctly
browse to api/values and api/agilistas
had to fix SQL of final flyway sql becuase it was missing USE DB_Agilistas at top
------now with test compose-----
it's not finding the env var from .env file
using appsettings.dev.json from API project
even when that's set to server=db, it's not able to connect to db (db exists)
why? boo hoo...this is a many many hour time sucker problem
test compose was only v3 where api compose was 3.4 so I fixed that but still fails
could differnet db container names be the problem? No that was the flyway container name so it doesn't matter
-what about the connection string in webappfactory file? No
-what about running modeltests from dockerfile, not from entrypoint.sh?  No
???why can the API container connect but the test container can't?
tried using ip address exposed by sql container: Server=192.168.112.2:1620;
****If I don't run the tests, the database gets created****

-------------------------below is really for next branch------
ensure that when running compose up from docker test that the dbconnection server is db, not localhost
Mistakes:
  I didn't include the 
  environment:
      - ConnectionStrings:DB_Conn

  setting in the docker-compose-test.yml for the test service 
  so it was using the conneciton string from appsettings.development.json which was localhost

I keep having to remove target from flyway service in compose
other mistakes: depends on missing on unittest service
